tic-tac-toe-minimax
===================

This is a simple Javascript implementation of the game Tic Tac Toe using the minimax algorithm for the computer player. The human player will at best tie the game. The application also keeps track of how much time did it take the minimax algorithm to search for the best move with the current state of the board and then it displays the results to the user. The game can be played at http://diegocasmo.me/projects/tic-tac-toe-minimax/.
As a note a side, I also made a version of this game using the Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm which will serve as a comparison for efficiency between the minimax and Alpha Beta Pruning. Here is the URL for Tic Tac Toe using Aplha Beta Pruning http://diegocasmo.me/projects/tic-tac-toe-alpha/
